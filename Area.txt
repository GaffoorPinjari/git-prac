coding:- Area 
1)Take the length(L) and breadth(B) of the rectangle as input and find its area.

Note:
Length and breadth must be an integer value and the area will always be in the range of integers.

Constraints:
1 <= L, B <= 10Ë†2
Sample Input 1:
4 20
Sample Output 1:
80
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 4*20=80.

(Code)
import java.util.Scanner;
class Solution {
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// Taking length and breadth as input
		int l = sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		int area;
		
		// Calculating area
		area = l * b;
		
		// Area as output
		System.out.println(area);
		
	}
}
